<center><p>WELCOME!</p>
<center><p>EST. December 18th 2025.</p>
<br><br>
<center><h1>WEEKLY SUMMARY</h1>
<center><p>Nothing here yet, wait for school to start.</p>
<br><br>
<center><h1>WHAT IS THIS SITE?</h1>
<center><p>Well, I made this site for 2 reasons; 1: The school is <i>really</i> scummy and is desparately trying to keep a fake
image, and 2: To be an <i>actual</i> trustworthy source while also being a funny little troll as the school freaks
out at the fact that this site alone has a solid chance of justifyingly driving people away from the place.</p>
