<center><h1 style="color:red;">THE PROBLEM WITH ENROLLING HUNDREDS OF KIDS A YEAR</h1>

<center><p class="ex1" style="color:red;">First problem I want to touch on, is how much kids we enroll here.

<br><br>

We definitely do not have enough lockers and room to store a bunch of kids just to find out 85% of the kids you enrolled are some of the most retarded, fuckin' braindead individuals. They stand in the middle of the hallways hoarding a kids locker to the point you sometimes have to go another way to simply get to where you want to go. Usually, you'll also find these peanuts
vaping in the bathrooms as well trying to take pictures over the stalls. Uncivilised fatherless behaviour at its finest!

<br><br>

So whats the solution to all this? We can either stop enrolling so many kids at once and limit the amount, or stop being soft and stop handing out 1-3 day suspensions left right and center. Grow a pear and expell a few. It's <i>not</i> that hard of a decision to make.

<br><br>

Now, I know that when people do start to see this site, there will be a quite a few of the mentioned above. All I can say to you is that; you <i>don't</i> look tough. You look goofy, <i>real</i> goofy.

<br><br>

Obviously, due to the fact people like this would go batshit friggin' crazy if they found out they were named on this site, I've at least given these lads & lass' some privacy. Even though you could easily tell these guys apart from other people, I'm not going to be naming anyone. Will these people clean up their act? Of course not. I will say again, that this site is mainly used as a "troll" to the school and a proper guide for parents wanting to enrol their kids.
